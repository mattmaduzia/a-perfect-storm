# A Perfect Storm
This is an open-source webapp, also hosted on [netlify](https://a-perfect-storm.netlify.app), that displays, as a choropleth (color-coded map), the [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) "[1981-2010 U.S. Climate Normals](ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/)" data by county and season/year.
 
 Tooltips also display next to the counties on hover or touch which include the county's main wikipedia image thumbnail, and the current forecast for the county from https://api.weather.gov.
 
 Lastly, a searchable, paginated list of counties ranked by chosen weather-type and time-period can be expanded from the bottom of the screen.
